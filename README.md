# Tour Guide App Project
The application lists all the tourist attractions that is popular and fun to experience. All the attractions are divided into
four categories, namely top activities, top restaurants, top breweries, and top bars/nightlife. 

The splash screen presents all the categories, which lists all the attractions as cards within each categories. This is 
achieved by nesting recycler views. A list view with all the attractons from a given category is also available. The list view 
is made available when the user clicks on the "Show All" button on the top right hand side of each category. Detailed 
description and fun facts about the attraction is provided in the details screen (single-click on the attraction). Further, an 
user can also use the app to find the location of an attraction on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps), which can then be used for navigation purposes.

This app has been built to the specifications of the tour guide app project rubric, which is part of the 
Multi-screen Apps module of [Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803).
